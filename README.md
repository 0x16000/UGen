# UGen
UGen is a password generator trying to make one's password as secure as possible.
Specifically it is meant as a safety tool for account purposes, supporting 1 to 18 characters of length.

# What is is secure of
Depends on what character length you would set it, generally 8-13 characters would make it bruteforce secure as it would have to take ages and no one can humanly guess it right.

# How to use the tool?
Since it's C++ you will have to use G++ on Linux,
compile using:
```bash
g++ -o UGen UGen.c
````

# Will it be updated or stay like this?
No, it will be updated since i try to help out people struggling with finding passwords, yes nothing is stored in a .txt for the generator as it would just be dumb, it generates a code specific randomized string with numbers symbols, and letters etc.
